* Welcome to Discover, my Soundcloud app Clone!
This application takes great inspiration from the music streaming service/music sharing platform SoundCloud, where users can sign in or sign up to upload their own songs, but are not required to do so.
In Discover, 

*The technologies I used for this project are as follows:

For the frontend:
React.js
Redux.js
CSS
Javascript


For the Backend:
Ruby on Rails

For the Database:


Hosting:

AWS for files (audio, images)
Heroku (for app deployment)
PostgreSQL 

Features

User Authentication

Users are able to log in with their own credentials, or as a demo user to have access to app features.
Sign in/Sign up forms validate errors* upon the user's action to log in or sign up.

Uploading

Signed-in users are able to upload songs they wish to share, with or without a photo.

User Profile Page

A user's profile page will show all of their uploaded music, should they upload any at all.
It will also have their profile picture displayed along with their username.
The same structure is followed for every user.


Coming soon

Playbar, to allow continuous play throughout the application as a User navigates through the website.
